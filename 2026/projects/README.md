# Advanced Analysis Workstreams

This directory houses three high-impact directions for the CSAS mixed doubles curling challenge. Each sub-folder contains documentation and starter code.

1. `powerplay_policy`: Dynamic power-play policy optimization via MDP / stochastic game modeling.
2. `shot_value_engine`: Shot evaluation and sequencing using symmetry-aware spatial analytics and Bayesian RL.
3. `counter_strategy`: Defensive counter-strategy simulator using opponent clustering and minimax optimization.

Each folder includes:
- A roadmap (`README.md`) describing goals, mathematical framing, and near-term tasks.
- A `src/` package with starter modules.
- A `notebooks/` directory ready for exploration.
